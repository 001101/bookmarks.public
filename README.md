bookmarks.public
================

This repository contains the single HTML file `index.html`.

The bookmarks file is a _template_ which is designed to be edited by the user,
simply replace the bookmarks in the single unordered-list with your own.

Open the file in a browser and you have a simple to use interface for your
bookmarks.

Rationale
---------

I didn't like any of the online bookmark-syncing plugins/addins/tools I tested.

The idea of hosting an online bookmark server is appealing, but using the
power of Git it seems that having a local bookmark file should be pretty robust;
new items can be added easily, and the javascript magic will make the list manageable.


Online Demo
-----------

You may [try out the interface](http://htmlpreview.github.com/?http://raw.github.com/skx/bookmarks.public/master/index.html) with the stub-bookmarks added in the sampel `index.html`.

The bookmarks in the demo are only those I added randomly, but are sufficient to show the
way it works.  Fork to your own repository or `wget` the RAW image and host it yourself if
you wish to keep your bookmarks private, as I do!
